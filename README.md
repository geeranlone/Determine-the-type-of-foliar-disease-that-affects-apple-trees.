# Determine-the-type-of-foliar-disease-that-affects-apple-trees.
Apple tree diseases seriously affect their health and
productivity. Accurate diagnosis of diseases is essential to early
treatment and can avoid yield loss. Traditional methods rely on
inefficient field scouting. In this project, we used machine learning
methods to classify apple tree diseases. We used histogram of
gradients (HOG) and pretrained CNNs to extract features.
